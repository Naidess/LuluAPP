Interacting with Lulu: Meet Lulu, your virtual pet, who will be with you every day. It is your responsibility to take care of her by providing everything she needs and spending quality time with her.

Mood States and Statistics: Lulu‚Äôs mood states are represented by images that reflect how she feels in the interface:

Complaints: An image is displayed if Lulu has complaints.
Dirty: An image appears if Lulu is dirty.
Energy: If she has low energy, she falls asleep.
Health: If Lulu gets sick, an image is shown based on her health condition.
There can also be a combination of these states.

Feed Lulu properly.
Make sure she gets enough rest.
Give her medicine if her health requires it.
Mood Initialization: Lulu‚Äôs mood states are initialized randomly with predetermined values.

You can increase her happiness by feeding her, ensuring she rests, or playing with her.

Development and Bug Fixes: There are currently a few bugs that will be resolved as the program develops. Right now, it‚Äôs just a skeleton.

Note:

The program takes time to close because all threads must finish before it can shut down.
The main part, which should display the program in the terminal, is also not working correctly and is pending fixes.
